            The latest and greatest gaming console is here, and it looks <em>very</em> familiar. The original Game Boy Color is back with a vengeance, and people can't get enough of them. The creator of the Game Boy, Tinyendo, is embracing this unexpected but welcome new direction; they've shut down a number of underperforming factories in order to ramp up production on the new line.

            Annabel Moretz, the company's CEO, said the change was a long time coming. "We've tried the Switch, we've tried VR, but nothing compares to the elegance and power of the original Game Boy Color," she says. She acknowledges that there may be push back from some industry players, but reiterates that "we can't stem the tide of progress".
